# Colours
Collaboration with Joel Daz√©
Code by Charles Matthews
Based on Joel's pitch colour assembly

## Notes
Not currently intended/licensed for use by others.  
This is a work in progress, and is presented as "source available" rather than "open source" at this time. 

We are currently using this repository to work towards a live performance using Joel's pitch colour assembly, so it's not laid out in a particularly user-friendly way.

The project as it stands has gradually been shifting from manipulating colour towards controlling DMX lights...we will need to decide whether this should be a separate project.

This project is supported by [CAMIN (Canadian Accessible Musical Instruments Network)](https://camin.network/), and also uses libraries developed as part of our [Sound Ideas project](https://blurringtheboundaries.github.io/sound-ideas/) in collaboration with the [National accessArts Centre](https://accessarts.ca/).
