# cm-toolbox
 
A set of tools I use in my daily development and therefore appear in a few current projects. 

Idiosyncratic and not really intended for use by others for the time being...

Some of these are workarounds from when I started learning JS and so may be redundant now.

Focus on music / sound manipulation -- some methods involve ToneJS. 
I haven't included Tone as a full dependency as there are not test/example pages yet.

With a temporary build script as I'm still learning the appropriate webpack config...hoping to convert to TypeScript soon.
